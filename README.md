# miteru

Quick simple file watcher.

# Easy to use

```bash
miteru '**/*.js' -e 'echo $evt: $file'
```

```javascript
var miteru = require( './dist/miteru.js' )
var watcher = miteru.watch( function ( evt, filepath ) {
  switch ( evt ) {
    case 'init':
      // only emitted once during the first polling cycle ( if the file exists )
      console.log( 'init: ' + filepath )
      break

    case 'add':
      // file was added ( did not exists previously, exists now )
      console.log( 'add: ' + filepath )
      break

    case 'change':
      // file was changed ( existed previously, exists now, mtime or content changed )
      console.log( 'change: ' + filepath )
      break

    case 'unlink':
      // file was removed ( existed previously, does not exist now )
      console.log( 'unlink: ' + filepath )
      break
  }
} )

watcher.add( 'src/**/*.js' )

setTimeout( function () {
  console.log( watcher.getWatched() ) // array of files being watched
  watcher.clear()
  console.log( watcher.getWatched() ) // empty array ( no files being watched )

  setTimeout( function () {
    watcher.add( 'package.json' )

    setTimeout( function () {
      watcher.clear() // will exit naturally because no files are being watched
    }, 3000 )
  }, 3000 )
}, 5000 )
```

# Install

locally ( project specific, for use with npm scripts )

```bash
npm install miteru
```

globally
```bash
npm install -g miteru
```

# Why

Simple file watching that "just works â„¢" as fast and as painless as possible.
Intended for watching files during development qickly and easily to trigger rebuilds etc.

# Alternatives

[chokidar](https://github.com/paulmillr/chokidar)
[chokidar-cli](https://github.com/kimmobrunfeldt/chokidar-cli)

# How

fs.stat polling. Ranks each file by temperature and sets the polling interval based on how HOT or COLD the file is.
